Hello World!
<!-- I'm currently serving my duty of military service as a technical research personnel. -->

I'm deeply interested in reducing the complexity that can eventually lessen the human’s effort.  

My research interests are as follows but not limited in:  
• Swarm Intelligence, Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory  
• Deep Learning Applications (particularly Reinforcement Learning and MARL)  
• Vision based Localization, Unmanned Vehicles (UAV, UGV)  
• Natural Language Processing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Embedding Techniques  


Luckily!  
There are still so many more things to learn!  

Enjoy my website!  
Thank you. ^^
