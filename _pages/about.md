Hello World!
<!-- I'm currently serving my duty of military service as a technical research personnel. -->

I'm deeply interested in reducing the complexity that can eventually lessen the human’s effort.

My research interests are as follows but not limited in:
• Swarm Intelligence, Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory
• Deep Learning Applications (particularly Reinforcement Learning and MARL)
• Vision based Localization, Unmanned Vehicles (UAV, UGV)
• Natural Language Processing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Embedding Techniques

Luckily!
There are still so many more things to learn!

Enjoy my website!
Thank you. ^^

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
